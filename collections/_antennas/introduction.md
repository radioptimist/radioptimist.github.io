This project is very near to me. It's a work in 
progress. In the mean time please enjoy an interactive
plot of a series of rotating dipoles. Each dipole 
is colored a little different, but they all represent
the theta far-fields of a dipole from a global frame as the 
dipole rotates by a fixed step.

Some basic controls for the interative plots on this site:
 - Rotate using left click and drag
 - Pan using left click while holding shift
 - Zoom using the mouse wheel
 - Reset pan/zoom by pressing R key
 - Show the wire edges of a mesh with the W key
 - Show the vertices of a mesh using the V key
 - Return to the full mesh using the S key
