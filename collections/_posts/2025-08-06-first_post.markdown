I really want to see a html export from pyvista rendered on the web-page. I really love the plotting tool and I think it’s a really solid approach to showing fun examples. Find more information about the pyvista project [here]:(https://pyvista.org).

## Controls for PyVista Plots throughout this site
Some basic controls for the interative plots on this site:
 - Rotate using left click and drag
 - Pan using left click while holding shift
 - Zoom using the mouse wheel
 - Reset pan/zoom by pressing R key
 - Show the wire edges of a mesh with the W key
 - Show the vertices of a mesh using the V key
 - Return to the full mesh using the S key
