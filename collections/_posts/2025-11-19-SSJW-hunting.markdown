Went for solo third rifle to the South San Juan Wilderness
and had an awesome time. Five nights and days, temperatures
really pleasant in the day (around 55) and bearable at
night (around 15). I learned a lot about the layout of 
the land in that corner of the wilderness and where 
the waskally-wapiti like to spend their time.

Outside of the hunt itself, world class backpacking and 
a great time. Water would freeze at night, so sleep with 
your filter or water bottle. Ice would only be about an 
inch or two and could bash it out with rocks.

First time using a hot tent and first time making strong
use of hiking poles, both of which are going to be core 
to my arsenal going forward. The tipi of choice was a 
Seek Outside Cimarron. Hiking poles take a hell of a load
off the joints up and down hills. Looking forward to 
coming back next year for some backpacking!
