After years of putting off a trip to Europe 
(pandemics, school, etc), Jackie and I finally took a 
trip to Munich for Oktoberfest! Bavaria is beautiful and
the aspens are starting to change color. Temperature
was quite temperate but we did encounter our fair share
of colder days and rain.

Some highlights from the trip besides Oktoberfest itself
include Neuschwanstein Castle, Linderhof Palace, and
Ettal Abbey. We also made a trip to the Dachau 
concentration camp; while very grim the visit was very
worthwhile and educational. I highly recommend 
a visit to the town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen,
Jackie and I had a great stay.
