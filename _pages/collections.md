This page is a grouping of software tutorials
and demonstrations, my ongoing projects,
and research topics that I've been burrowing into.
Tutorials are on topics that 
I have extensie background in and are typically
associated with a github project.
Projects is a less specific collection of robotics, 
home automation, and other passion project topics.
The research section serves mostly as a diary to 
organize my thoughts and paper reading lists as 
well as host any software experiments that help cement
understanding.
