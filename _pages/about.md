I’m Dan Rosen, and I study optimization in the wild. I consider myself an optimist: a scientist who studies the operating conditions, techniques, and applications of optimization applied to numerous physics and engineering problems as well as a person who seeks out positive outcomes, influences, and aspirations. I use this site to:

- Explain, exemplify, and elaborate on the code that I manage on [github](https://github.com/radioptimist)
-  Host an organized diary for research topics, readings, and experiments
- Serve as an interactive portfolio and resume
- Practice algorithm development in Python, CUDA, C, etc

## Background
I’m from Colorado Springs, CO and I’ve lived my whole life in the state. I attended the Colorado School of Mines and studied Engineering Physics (BS ’16), Electrical Engineering (MS ’17), and conducted my PhD in Electrical Engineering under Gongguo Tang and Mike Wakin (PhD ’19-’24). Outside of academic research I’ve worked as a professional signal processing developer for the past 8 years. At some point I will make a link to a Resume/CV that documents my various professional positions.

## Research Interests
My primary research interests tend to follow a few categorical veins:
- Optimization: convexity, constraints, low-rank tensor problems, compressed sensing, structured inverse problems.
- “Traditional” Signal Processing: communication, encoding, link studies, correlation processing, software-defined radio, resampling, conditioning, signal separation, radar processing, Kalman/Particle Bayesian style dynamic filters, cyclostationarity.
- Data Science: Feature-extraction and learning, regression and modeling, conditioning and normalization, dimensionality reduction, data simulation and validation. Markov models, Viterbi decoding, parameter estimation, Fisher information.
- Radio Physics: Ionospherics and HF propagation, antenna theory, non-traditional array processing, front-end and device physics, FDTD/MoM/FEM simulation.
- Ultrafast Optics: Pulse characterization, non-linear optics, temporal resolution techniques.
- Computer Vision: pose estimation, multiple view geometry, surface reconstruction, point-cloud processing.
- New topics I’ve been chasing: chaos, information and memetics, history, linguistics, finance.


## Personal Interests
I do have hobbies outside science and work!
- BJJ
- Hiking, hunting, camping
- Gardening and cooking
- Sourdough
- HAM radio 
- 3D printing, laser-cutting
- Animation, modeling, photogrammetry
